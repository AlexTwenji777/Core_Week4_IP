Th Project was carried out to determine if the mean of the number of blue_cars taken from postcodes starting with ‘75’ is at least similar to that of all the Paris postcodes. To investigate this, our hypothesis was:

The Null Hypothesis is that the mean of blue_cars taken in postcodes starting with ‘75’ is greater than or equal to that of all the Paris postcodes.

The Alternate Hypothesis is that the mean of blue_cars taken in postcodes starting with ‘75’ during the is less than that of all the Paris postcodes.
